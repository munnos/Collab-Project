# Movietails

As a group we formulated the following user story and criteria as listed below.

## User story 

As a group, we settled for the following as a user story:

"As a film and cocktails fan, I want to be presented with a selection of films linked to cocktail suggestions which correspond in theme to the genre of film chosen, alongside a recipe on how to make said cocktail, so that I do not waste time searching for a film and I can enjoy a cocktail in comfort".

## Criteria

As a group we set ourselves the following criteria for our application:

"Given I want to use a film and cocktail generator application to provide film and cocktail recommendations, when I open the application, then I am presented with a selection of film genres to choose from and a random selection option. 

When I select one film genre, then I am presented with a selection of film reccomendations and paired cocktails. When I click on the film overview button then I am presented with a synopsis of the film. 

When I click on the cocktail instruction button, I want to see the recipe and ingredients.

When I select the family film genre, then I want to be presented with non-alocholic cocktail recommendations.

When I select the random film and cocktail pairing, I want to see only one film and cocktail recommendation."
